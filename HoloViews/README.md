Question: What's the simplest way to make high quality plots in Python?
Answer: ðŸ‘‰ HoloViews! ðŸ‘ˆ

" HoloViews is an open-source Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple. With HoloViews, you can usually express what you want to do in very few lines of code, letting you focus on what you are trying to explore and convey, not on the process of plotting. "
- From the official HoloViews.org page, couldn't have described it better myself!

HoloViews acts as a high-level API and extends your favorite plotting libraries, making them much more intuitive to use. Very similar to how Keras greatly simplifies working with TensorFlow.

That isn't to say that you can't make complex visualizations with HoloViews, quite the contrary! In this video I'll be demonstrating how you can easily make an interactive dashboard with a scrollbar with few lines of HoloViews code.
