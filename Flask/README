Deploy your ML models easily with Flask! ⚗️

Deploying a trained machine learning model successfully for other people to use and enjoy, is an increasingly important skill, but often neglected in the curriculum of a data scientist.

In many companies, the task of model deployment is the sole responsibility of the software engineering team, but I believe that as this field advances, this privilege will not be sustainable, and the data scientist will have to gain at least some capabilities and knowledge in model deployment. Just think about how DevOps started.

Flask is a lightweight web application framework. It is designed to allow you get started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.
This is a great package to learn how to make RESTful APIs with Python and experiment with making small apps for your ML models.

In the following weeks I'll post a series of videos regarding ML model deployment, with gradual increasing complexity. 
In this first video tutorial I show how to deploy a text sentiment analysis model in a simple Flask web app, allowing you to type free text to be analyzed by the model.
This app will be developed and hosted locally, and the focus of the next video will be on how to host it on a remote server.
