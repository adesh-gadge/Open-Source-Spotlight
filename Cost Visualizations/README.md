Stop doing 3D plots with Matplotlib! ‚ùå

Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs. It's based on JavaScript and similar to Bokeh which I covered last week. I especially like using Plotly for creating 3D interactive plots. It has an intuitive API for passing the data and creating the grid required for 3D plotting. Much simpler and flexible compared to other libraries.

In addition, in this video I'm also doing some analysis on cost function surfaces, using Plotly to visualize them and explore their appearance for a linear model and a simple neural network.

With these "Machine Learning & Data Science Open Source Spotlight" weekly videos, my objective is to introduce many game-changing libraries, which I believe many people can benefit from.
