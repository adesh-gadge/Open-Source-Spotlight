Real-time interactive(!) big data visualizations with Datashader + Bokeh 👁️

The main challenge of visualizing huge datasets is NOT computing power or memory! It's actually making meaningful plots which are able to highlight the dense sections in your data together with the outliers.

Datashader pre-renders even the largest datasets into a fixed-size raster image that faithfully represents the data’s distribution. Together with Bokeh, we can build interactive plots that dynamically re-render these images when zooming and panning, allowing you to always get the best data representation of an area-of-interest.
