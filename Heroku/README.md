Heroku is a platform as a service that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

If you don't have any hardware or driver requirements like GPU or CUDA for your ML app to run, it's so convenient to host your app on Heroku! It builds the container environment for you just by passing a simple requirements.txt describing what's needed to run your Python program.

In addition, it has a reasonable free service plan, so you can experiment with deploying your personal projects and share them with other people.

In the next videos, I'll present more advanced, production-grade solutions to deploy your ML models, utilizing GPU/TPUs, clusters and options for offline edge-computing (e.g. drones).
