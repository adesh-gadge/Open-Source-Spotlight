Are you using bokeh? ðŸ“Š

bokeh is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. Although it's an already well-established Python package with sponsors, I think not many people are choosing this tool for data visualizations. 
With this short tutorial I'm aiming to help you get started with this great package, so you can easily start making professional-looking interactive plots.

With these "Machine Learning & Data Science Open Source Spotlight" weekly videos, my objective is to introduce many game-changing libraries, which I believe many people can benefit from.
