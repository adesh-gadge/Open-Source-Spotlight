Should you use Dask or PySpark for Big Data? ðŸ¤”

Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python.
In this video I give a tutorial on how to use Dask for parallel computing, handling Big Data and integration with Deep Learning frameworks.
I compare Dask to PySpark and list the relative advantages I see of choosing Dask as your primary choice for Big Data handling.

With these "Machine Learning & Data Science Open Source Spotlight" weekly videos, my objective is to introduce many game-changing libraries, which I believe many people can benefit from.
